# Run Tracking Website

## Description

We have created a simple run tracking website to track a persons runs and calculate stats. Runs are tracked by distance either in miles or in Kilometers and by time. Using this information, the stats of Average speed and minute split per unit are calculated as well. The website also tabulates total distance and time ran, along with average speed per unit and minute split per unit. This website can help runners track their runs over a period of time and have log of different metrics to help in future runs.
